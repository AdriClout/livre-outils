  abstract = {Scholars routinely make claims that presuppose the validity of the observations and measurements that operationalize their concepts. Yet, despite recent advances in political science methods, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to measurement validity. We address this gap by exploring four themes. First, we seek to establish a shared framework that allows quantitative and qualitative scholars to assess more effectively, and communicate about, issues of valid measurement. Second, we underscore the need to draw a clear distinction between measurement issues and disputes about concepts. Third, we discuss the contextual specificity of measurement claims, exploring a variety of measurement strategies that seek to combine generality and validity by devoting greater attention to context. Fourth, we address the proliferation of terms for alternative measurement validation procedures and offer an account of the three main types of validation most relevant to political scientists.},

It then describes how FOSS ``works,'' that is, the collaborative and legal practices on which some of the most successful FOSS projects rely. The chapter presents the mainstream adoption of FOSS and a survey of some of the research to date on FOSS. It describes in more detail some of the aspects of FOSS. Public administrations around the world have also embraced FOSS as a way to reduce costs or assert their sovereignty, and many social activists use it to develop autonomous infrastructures. The chapter ends by addressing some of the challenges this peer-production model faces, in particular when related to tensions arising from its marketization as well as from participants' lack of diversity.},

Our aim is to explore the intersection between FOSS and computational reproducibility. We begin by situating FOSS in relation to other `open' initiatives, and specifically open science, open research, and open scholarship. In this context, we argue that anyone who actively contributes to the research process today is a computational researcher, in that they use computers to manage and store information. We then provide a primer to FOSS suitable for anyone concerned with research quality and sustainability---including researchers in any field, as well as support staff, administrators, publishers, funders, and so on. Next, we illustrate how the notions introduced in the primer apply to resources for scientific computing, with reference to the GNU Scientific Library as a case study. We conclude by discussing why the common interpretation of `open source' as `open code' is misplaced, and we use this example to articulate the role of FOSS in research and scholarship today. This article is part of the theme issue `Reliability and reproducibility in computational science: implementing verification, validation and uncertainty quantification in silico'.},

Here we examine breakthroughs over the past decade that include self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, and geometric deep learning, which leverages knowledge about the structure of scientific data to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI toolsneed a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.}

In this field, data is the new resource, and knowledge is extracted from materials datasets that are too big or complex for traditional human reasoning---typically with the intent to discover new or improved materials or materials phenomena. Multiple factors, including the open science movement, national funding, and progress in information technology, have fueled its development. Such related tools as materials databases, machine learning, and high-throughput methods are now established as parts of the materials research toolset. However, there are a variety of challenges that impede progress in data-driven materials science: data veracity, integration of experimental and computational data, data longevity, standardization, and the gap between industrial interests and academic efforts. In this perspective article, the historical development and current state of data-driven materials science, building from the early evolution of open science to the rapid expansion of materials data infrastructures are discussed. Key successes and challenges so far are also reviewed, providing a perspective on the future development of the field.},

  abstract = {Background: Reflection is well established as an important part of teacher education, but it is also the focus of critical enquiry. This means that reflection is of interest to those who wish to explore its use to produce `better' teachers. It is also of interest to scholars who are interested in the wider implications of reflection, for example, in relation to power and social control. Academic articles are the primary medium through which ideas and practices are communicated. However, they can only contribute if they are accepted for publication on the basis of making a contribution to knowledge. To be seen in this way, a journal paper needs to cite earlier work to show understanding of this work and how this is being augmented. Purpose: This paper aims to initiate an academic debate of citation practices which, it argues, should be based on an awareness of current practices and a willingness to share, and even change, them. To facilitate the debate and the development of a better understanding of citing and its implications, the paper offers a tripartite citation framework. Sources of evidence: The extensive citation analysis literature is reviewed to provide a context for an examination of the variety of citation practices found in 24 papers, which all focus on initial teacher education and which cite the same critical paper (Fendler, L., Teacher reflection in a hall of mirrors: Historical influences and political reverberations. Educational Researcher, 32, no. 3: 16--25, 2003; doi: 10.3102/0013189X032003016). Main argument: This paper argues that there is value in differentiating three categories of citation, labelled `cameo', `supporting role' and `star'. These categories do not make judgements about what counts as `good' or `bad' referencing. Rather, they provide a way for authors to assess how they are citing and what the possible consequences may be. These can include an apparent lack of understanding not just of a cited paper but also of the wider literature. This means that citation that is not being carefully managed can undermine an argument. Conclusions: This paper concludes that there is there is a need to initiate an academic debate about citation which is premised on the development of self-awareness about current practice and its consequences. Such a debate could bring about a number of benefits. It would encourage individual scholars to develop self-aware and ethical citation; it would also clarify current expectations about citation and enable academic communities to reflect on whether enquiry is well served by them.},

Yet in computational hydrology the code and data that actually produces published results are not regularly made available, inhibiting the ability of the community to reproduce and verify previous findings. In order to overcome this problem we recommend that reuseable code and formal workflows, which unambiguously reproduce published scientific results, are made available for the community alongside data, so that we can verify previous findings, and build directly from previous work. In cases where reproducing large-scale hydrologic studies is computationally very expensive and time-consuming, new processes are required to ensure scientific rigor. Such changes will strongly improve the transparency of hydrological research, and thus provide a more credible foundation for scientific advancement and policy support.},

Employing a ``microhistories'' methodology, we document how actors in the free/open-source movement took steps that enabled an alternate technological niche to form, gain momentum and eventually infiltrate the extant regime. Our account delineates the key role that actors play in shaping the identity of a niche, amplifying its presence, and finally mainstreaming it. We observe a heterogenous response by incumbents to the emergent niche and highlight the sustained coexistence of a niche and regime as a distinct form of technological transition. Finally, we demonstrate the significant impact that a niche can have, spanning beyond the targeted regime, and becoming part of the landscape. Our insights highlight how tracing the processes involved in the emergence and development of a niche can provide a prospective and generative understanding of technological transition, thereby contributing to and complementing the extant SNM and MLP literatures.},

In this manuscript, we assess code sharing and model documentation practices of 7500 publications about individual-based and agent-based models. The code availability increased over the years, up to 18\% in 2018. Model documentation does not include all the elements that could improve the transparency of the models, such as mathematical equations, flow charts, and pseudocode. We find that articles with equations and flow charts being cited more among other model papers, probably because the model documentation is more transparent. The practices of code sharing improve slowly over time, partly due to the emergence of more public repositories and archives, and code availability requirements by journals and sponsors. However, a significant change in norms and habits need to happen before computational modeling becomes a reproducible science.},

Kelty investigates the history and cultural significance of Free Software, revealing the people and practices that have transformed not only software but also music, film, science, and education. Free Software is a set of practices devoted to the collaborative creation of software source code that is made openly and freely available through an unconventional use of copyright law. Kelty explains how these specific practices have reoriented the relations of power around the creation, dissemination, and authorization of all kinds of knowledge. He also makes an important contribution to discussions of public spheres and social imaginaries by demonstrating how Free Software is a "recursive public"--a public organized around the ability to build, modify, and maintain the very infrastructure that gives it life in the first place. Drawing on ethnographic research that took him from an Internet healthcare start-up company in Boston to media labs in Berlin to young entrepreneurs in Bangalore, Kelty describes the technologies and the moral vision that bind together hackers, geeks, lawyers, and other Free Software advocates. In each case, he shows how their practices and way of life include not only the sharing of software source code but also ways of conceptualizing openness, writing copyright licenses, coordinating collaboration, and proselytizing. By exploring in detail how these practices came together as the Free Software movement from the 1970s to the 1990s, Kelty also considers how it is possible to understand the new movements emerging from Free Software: projects such as Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that creates copyright licenses, and Connexions, a project to create an online scholarly textbook commons.},

For example, hypersonic research has experienced numerous cycles since the 1950s, with various periods of high research activity, followed by equally long periods of very low activity. This lack of continuity in high-speed flow research has led to a situation where researchers of one ``generation'' often do not know what the researchers of previous ``generations'' have done, mainly due to large losses of institutional knowledge in government, industry, and academic organizations. Therefore, a chronically weak area in research papers, reports, and reviews is the complete identification of critical background documents that form the building blocks and intellectual heritage for modern compressible flow research. A method for systematically determining these critical references is presented in the context of its application to high-speed flow using Citation-Assisted Background, which is based on the assumption that many critical documents tend to be highly cited within the literature, although not necessarily recently. While Citation-Assisted Background is a highly systematic approach for identifying critical references, it is not a substitute for the judgement of the researchers, but rather complements their expertise. In this critical review of high-speed compressible flow, important documents have been identified using Citation-Assisted Background, but other documents have been added by the authors to enhance the picture provided by the highly-cited documents.},

The feasibility of replications, however, hinges on the premise that original researchers make their data and research code publicly available. This applies in particular to large-N observational studies, where analysis code is complex and may involve several ambiguous analytical decisions. To investigate which specific factors influence researchers' code sharing behavior upon request, we emailed code requests to 1,206 authors who published research articles based on data from the European Social Survey between 2015 and 2020. In this preregistered multifactorial field experiment, we randomly varied three aspects of our code request's wording in a 2x4x2 factorial design: the overall framing of our request (enhancement of social science research, response to replication crisis), the appeal why researchers should share their code (FAIR principles, academic altruism, prospect of citation, no information), and the perceived effort associated with code sharing (no code cleaning required, no information). Overall, 37.5\% of successfully contacted authors supplied their analysis code. Of our experimental treatments, only framing affected researchers' code sharing behavior, though in the opposite direction we expected: Scientists who received the negative wording alluding to the replication crisis were more likely to share their research code. Taken together, our results highlight that the availability of research code will hardly be enhanced by small-scale individual interventions but instead requires large-scale institutional norms.},

To generalize our approaches, we additionally explore the variations in site security and architecture that analysts may encounter during the scraping process before they are given access to the desired data. The approaches we introduce do not rely on any proprietary software and can be easily implemented on any computing platform with programming languages such as Python or R. The methodological discussion in this study is meant to be applicable to current web-based research efforts. We include three examples with complete Python implementation. We also present an integrated workflow that enables researchers to produce analytical data sets that are traceable and thus verifiable for analysis or replication. Lastly, options related to the validity and efficiency of data are discussed, and we highlight the ongoing debate surrounding the ethics of online data collection, ultimately advocating for the fair use of online data.},

  abstract = {Technology driven changings with consecutive increase in the on-line availability and accessibility of journals and papers rapidly changes patterns of academic communication and publishing. The dissemination of important research findings through the academic and scientific community begins with publication in peer-reviewed journals. Aim of this article is to identify, critically evaluate and integrate the findings of relevant, high-quality individual studies addressing the trends of enhancement of visibility and accessibility of academic publishing in digital era. The number of citations a paper receives is often used as a measure of its impact and by extension, of its quality. Many aberrations of the citation practices have been reported in the attempt to increase impact of someone's paper through manipulation with self-citation, inter-citation and citation cartels. Authors revenues to legally extend visibility, awareness and accessibility of their research outputs with uprising in citation and amplifying measurable personal scientist impact has strongly been enhanced by on line communication tools like networking (LinkedIn, Research Gate, Academia.edu, Google Scholar), sharing (Facebook, Blogs, Twitter, Google Plus) media sharing (Slide Share), data sharing (Dryad Digital Repository, Mendeley database, PubMed, PubChem), code sharing, impact tracking. Publishing in Open Access journals. Many studies and review articles in last decade have examined whether open access articles receive more citations than equivalent subscription toll access) articles and most of them lead to conclusion that there might be high probability that open access articles have the open access citation advantage over generally equivalent payfor-access articles in many, if not most disciplines. But it is still questionable are those never cited papers indeed ``Worth(less) papers'' and should journal impact factor and number of citations be considered as only suitable indicators to evaluate quality of scientists? ``Publish or perish'' phrase usually used to describe the pressure in academia to rapidly and continually publish academic work to sustain or further one's career can now in 21.

First, the elements of qualitative research are described and understood as an approach linked to the interpretation and meanings that are given to the world. Secondly, the functions and handling of the RQDA software are explained. The main feature of RQDA is the fact that it is a free and open-source cross-platform tool, which allows project administration for data management purposes. The results show that even with the limitations that this type of tool may have, they offer a series of advantages that make their use possible and desirable to develop quality social research. Regarding the conclusions section, a reflection is offered on the use of technology based on free software for social research purposes, which must consider the pros and cons during its implementation. Concepts such as that of open access, or free culture, incorporate various forms of attending to historical problems suffered by science and education.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about the software used in scientific investigations is necessary for different reasons, including provenance of the results, measuring software impact to attribute developers, and bibliometric software citation analysis in general. Additionally, providing information about whether and how the software and the source code are available allows an assessment about the state and role of open source software in science in general. While such analyses can be done manually, large scale analyses require the application of automated methods of information extraction and linking. In this paper, we present SoftwareKG---a knowledge graph that contains information about software mentions from more than 51,000 scientific articles from the social sciences. A silver standard corpus, created by a distant and weak supervision approach, and a gold standard corpus, created by manual annotation, were used to train an LSTM based neural network to identify software mentions in scientific articles. The model achieves a recognition rate of .82 F-score in exact matches. As a result, we identified more than 133,000 software mentions. For entity disambiguation, we used the public domain knowledge base DBpedia. Furthermore, we linked the entities of the knowledge graph to other knowledge bases such as the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph, the Software Ontology, and Wikidata. Finally, we illustrate, how SoftwareKG can be used to assess the role of software in the social sciences.},

  abstract = {Twitter is an important object of research in social science studies, and the emergence of numerous Twitter software tools has provided researchers with the possibility of gaining insights into Twitter data; however, at the same time, early stage researchers may experience difficulties in selecting the most suitable tool for their own projects. Due to personal or institutional financial constraints, the purchase of commercial software is not a wise investment for all researchers. Hence, this article aims to provide a review of nine different free-of-charge and low-cost software tools for studying Twitter and highlights their advantages and disadvantages, in order to serve as a guide for social science scholars. This review is divided into two parts: background information and data retrieval features of the software tools, and their data analysis features. At the end of the review, several recommendations and suggestions are made for the use of these tools.},

  abstract = {Citation is considered as an essential part in any academic writing whereby it is one way for writers to support any claims or arguments made in their study with literature from previous research. Literature review is known as a chapter which provides background for research described in a thesis. However, relatively not many studies are done on literature review chapter of thesis which may be due to the extensive nature of the text. Writing academic texts such as a thesis requires an author to acknowledge other researchers' work through proper use of citations. Learning the appropriate way to cite is important in any kinds of academic writing especially among research students who are writing their theses. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the citation practices in doctoral theses of Chemical Engineering. The purpose of this study is two folds; i) to identify the types of citations used in the corpus (using Swale's 1990 categorization) and ii) to examine the functions related to the citations used (using Thompson's 2001 framework). Three literature review chapters were analysed first to identify the types of citations used in the mini corpus and the functions related to the citations. The results of the study show that engineering student writers mostly used Non-integral citations as compared to Integral. The study concludes with a discussion on the skills of citing the literature which should be given more attention to raise the awareness level among students.},
